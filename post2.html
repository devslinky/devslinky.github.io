                                <h3>An Abstract</h3>
                                <p>The idea and purpose of this projects stems from a case study presented to me in my coursework at University. The case study details WARP Shoe Company, a shoe manifacturing company, that aims to maximize their profit at their end-of-month sale in February.</p>
								<h3>A short introduction</h3>
                                <p>WARP shoe company is an established shoe manufacturer and retailer in Canada. At the beginning of 2006, one of WARP’s major market competitors of WARP went bankrupt. With a closing inventory in January of 0 shoes; WARP management seeks to take advantage of the market disruption and optimize their profit at their shoe sale at the end of February.</p>
								<h3>Key points</h3>
                                <p>In order to successfully maximize their profit; the management provided vital information to consider when formulating an optimal solution.</p>
                                <li>WARP Shoe Company can spend upmost $10,000,000 for raw materials required to produce shoes.</li>
                                <li>Not producing enough shoes to meet shoe demand will result in a loss of potential customers. This loss has been estimated at a cost of $10/pair.</li>
                                <li>All machines will continuously run 12 hours a day, 28 days a month; the set up costs and time are to be neglected.</li>
                                <li>Each machine will be operated by 1 worker; who will be paid a wage of $25/hr.</li>
                                <p>Additional information such as shoe prices, historical demand, raw material costs and quantity, operating costs etc have been provided in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tHhncJkvpqWZVYOdxhKy_FsW-KkcGEp6">Microsoft Access database.</a> </p>
								<p>Given the provided information, a problem formulation was devised (see below).</p>
                                <img src="images/WARP_pic05.png" alt="Problem Formulation shown"/>
                                <p>The problem formulation was programmed into AMPL, where an optimized production plan was found.</p>
                                <h3>Results</h3>
                                <p>Using AMPL, the problem formulation was implemented to obtain the optimal production plan to maximize WARPs’ profit. This production plan can be found in the case study report linked at the end of this article. With the provided production plan, it is of firm belief that WARP may be able to obtain a maximum profit of $13,046,000 by the end of February</p>
